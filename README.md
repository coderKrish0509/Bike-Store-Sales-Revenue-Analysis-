🚴 BIKE STORE SALES ANALYSIS 📊🚦

I am excited to share a project on Bike Store Sales Analysis using Power BI. 📈🔍

The main objective of this project is to analyze retail bike sales data from 2016 to 2018 and gain actionable insights that can help improve overall performance and business decision-making.

👉 Recommended Analysis of this project:

How does total revenue trend over the years?

Which brands generated the highest sales?

What is the revenue contribution by each store location?

How do product categories perform across different cities?

Which year had the best and worst sales?

What are the high-performing product categories?

What is the revenue distribution across cities?

🔑 Key Findings:
🔹The year 2017 recorded the highest revenue of $3.45M, while 2018 showed a decline with only $1.81M.

🔹Total revenue for the full period (2016–2018) is $7.69M.

🔹Trek emerged as the leading brand, contributing 59.86% of total revenue.

🔹The Baldwin store is the top-performing outlet with $5.2M in sales

🔹Mountain Bikes are the best-selling category, especially in Baldwin.

🔹Revenue grew by $293.41K from 2016 to 2017, surpassing the target by 7.44%.

🔹Geographic revenue analysis shows strong performance in Baldwin and Santa Cruz.

💡Insights:
🔹A deep dive into 2018’s decline can help reverse negative trends and regain growth.

🔹Focusing on top-performing brands like Trek can maximize profitability.

🔹Expanding successful product categories (e.g., Mountain and Road Bikes) in underperforming cities could boost overall sales.

🔹AI visuals in Power BI (Q&A, Smart Narrative) can help decision-makers understand key drivers more easily.

🔹Use city-level insights to run targeted campaigns and improve store-specific strategies.
